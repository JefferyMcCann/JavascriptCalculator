# JavascriptCalculator
me learning some javascript using html for buttons and making a dynamic calculator 

This is the base method I use for learning the basics of programming languages so that I can then 
use it in other applications. 


currently working on adding extra symbols such as pi, more complex math and the continuation of the anws function through calculations. 


current goals are to add a more asynchronous method of calculator buttons to have less code with the same level of functionality.
