# JavascriptCalculator
me learning some javascript using html for buttons and making a dynamic calculator 

This is the base method I use for learning the basics of programming languages so that I can then 
use it in other applications. 


currently working on adding extra symbols such as pi, more complex math and the continuation of the anws function through calculations.
